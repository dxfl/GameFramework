Backlog:

* When two transitions need to execute the same code (for example, there are two ways to reach the start of a turn, 
and there's something to do), the code is duplicated. Think about implementing code that executes when entering a state.

* Class hierarchy for game utilities related to rounds, turns and phases
	- TurnBasedGame: you have a list of players. A round consists on a turn for each player. (Carcassonne, TTA)
	- PhaseBasedGame: a round consists of a list of phases performed by all players in turn (Stronghold)
	- Hooks and methods for start/end round, turn and phase
